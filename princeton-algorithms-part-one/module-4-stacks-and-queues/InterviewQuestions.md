## Stacks And Queues

1. Queue with two stacks
   - If you push elements onto a stack and then pop them all, they appear in reverse order. If you repeat this process they are now back in order.

2. Stack with max
   - Use two stacks, one to store all of the items and a second stack to store the maximums.

3. Java Generics
   - Because arrays are covariant while generic types are not.
